# 2018-STSS-Olympics-Analysis

### Dependencies
- Python 3.6: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
- sqlite3: included in Python standard library
- plotyly: https://plot.ly/d3-js-for-python-and-pandas-charts/
- scipy: included in PYthon standard library

### Instructions
1) After installing all dependencies, download the "STSS-Olympic-Analysis.py" file and the "sqldb.sql" file. Place them in the same folder.
2) Run the "STSS-Olympic-Analysis.py".
3) A browser window will pop up with a scatterplot which has been fitted with a linear regression line.

### Brief Analysis of Results
  This short project was to examine the correlation between height and weight for female US Olympic Short Track Speed Skaters. With the inclusion of the regression line, we can see that most athletes do not fall within the average height/weight ratio. To further analyze this data, I would compare the top three medalists in each of the three events in my database and determine their individual deviation from the regression line. This would allow me to determine whether it is better to fall closer to or farther from the average for female US Short Track Speed Skaters.
